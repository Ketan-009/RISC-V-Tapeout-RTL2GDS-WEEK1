## About This Repository

This repository chronicles my participation in **India's Most Ambitious RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program** - a groundbreaking initiative by **IIT Gandhinagar** and **VLSI System Design (VSD)**.

### Mission
Contributing to India's semiconductor self-reliance through hands-on chip design expertise, aligned with the national goal of **"One Tapeout Per Student"**.

### Program Highlights
- **20-week intensive journey** from RTL to silicon
- **Industry-grade tools** and methodologies
- **End-to-end chip design** experience
- **Nation-building through technology**

### Week 1 ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

This Labs were organized in 5 days. This includes:

- [Day 1: Introduction to Verilog RTL Design & Synthesis](Day1.md)
- [Day 2: Timing Libraries, Synthesis Approaches, and Efficient Flip-Flop Coding](Day2.md)
- [Day 3: Combinational and Sequential Optimization](Day3.md)
- [Day 4: Gate-Level Simulation (GLS), Blocking vs. Non-Blocking in Verilog, and Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch ](Day4.md)
- [Day 5: Optimization in Synthesis ](Day5.md)

### üôè Acknowledgments
