# Enhanced Comprehensive Theory Sections

## Gate-Level Simulation
### Primary Verification Goals
- **Modes**: Ensure all operational modes are verified.
- **Equivalence**: Verify that the gate-level simulation matches the expected behavior of the RTL.
- **Reset Integrity**: Confirm that reset signals behave as expected across all scenarios.
- **DFT/Scan Considerations**: Assess the impact of design for test (DFT) and scan techniques on simulation results.

### Strategy and Pass Criteria
- Define clear metrics for pass/fail criteria.
- Document verification strategies and methodologies used during testing.

## Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch
### Key Drivers and Prevention
- **Root Causes**: Identify sources of mismatch such as incorrect assumptions made during synthesis.
- **Assignment Semantics**: Understand how different assignment types can affect simulation outcomes.
- **Safe Coding Practices**: Implement coding standards that minimize the risk of mismatches.
- **Tooling**: Utilize tools effectively to catch mismatches early in the design process.
- **Debug Flow**: Establish a systematic debug flow to identify and resolve mismatches.
- **Sign-off Mindset**: Cultivate a mindset focused on thorough verification before sign-off.

## Blocking vs Non-Blocking Assignments
### Usage Guidance and Pitfalls
- **Mental Model**: Develop a clear understanding of the execution order of blocking and non-blocking assignments.
- **Correct Use Patterns**: Provide examples of appropriate use cases for each type of assignment.
- **Common Pitfalls**: Highlight frequent mistakes and how to avoid them.
- **Review Checklist**: Create a checklist to verify the correct application of assignments in designs.
- **Expected Outcomes**: Describe the expected results when using each type properly.
